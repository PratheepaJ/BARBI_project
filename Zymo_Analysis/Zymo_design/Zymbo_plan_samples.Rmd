We requested sequence data from Zymbo research.

We try to figured out the dilutation.

P_133 Enterobacter .15 = 200/1347


P_036 Kelbsiella .61=213/347

Strep  .88= 680/776

6-fold dilution
1, 6, 36, 216, 1296, 7776

and 5-10 negative control samples - similar in depth


Update on the Zymbo 

Microbiome standard (D6300) is very concentrated.

Each prep (75microliter) has 10^9 bacterial cells. DNA extraction process has about 100-300 cells of contmainants in the backgorund. 

Could this affect how we determine dilution series?

How many reads do you require for the sequencing of these samples? 100k paired-end reads?
